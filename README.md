## Problem: Red and Blue

This is a problem written in Chinese, so I translated it as below.

### Problem Description

You have been given a tree and have been asked to color each vertex red or blue.

Requirements: Each red point is surrounded by one and only one red point, and each blue point is surrounded by one and only one blue point.

Definition of "around": Points around a point are points that are directly connected by neighboring edges.

### Input Description

The first line is a positive integer $n$, representing the number of vertices of the tree ($1 \le n \le 100000).

### Output Description
