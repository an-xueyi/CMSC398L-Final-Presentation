# CMSC398L Final Presentation

## Problem: Red and Blue

This is a problem written in Chinese, so I translated it as below.

### Desciption

You have been given a tree and have been asked to color each vertex red or blue.

Requirements: Each red point is surrounded by one and only one red point, and each blue point is surrounded by one and only one blue point.

Definition of "around": Points around a point are points that are directly connected by neighboring edges.
